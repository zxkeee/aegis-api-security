# coverage-gate.sh — fail CI if a critical package regresses below its floor.
#
# The release goal is >=70% on critical packages (RELEASE-CHECKLIST, Pillar 3).
# We are not there on every package yet, so this gate enforces a per-package
# FLOOR set to the current level: it locks in regression-test coverage of the
# security fixes and prevents back-sliding. Raise a floor whenever you raise the
# real coverage — the floors should ratchet up toward 70.
#
# Usage: scripts/coverage-gate.sh
set -euo pipefail

# "package floor" — minimum percent (integer) per critical package. Ratchet
# these up as real coverage rises; never down. Portable (no assoc arrays, so it
# runs on macOS bash 3.2 as well as CI).
