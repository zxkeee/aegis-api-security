// BehaviorAnalysis calculates a risk score for each request and blocks high-risk IPs.
//
// Flow (preventive, not reactive):
//  1. Score is calculated from the IP's PRIOR request history before the request is served.
//  2. If score >= threshold the request is blocked immediately.
//  3. After the request, metrics are recorded so the next request sees updated data.
//
// This means a SEQUENTIAL request from an IP that has built up a high score is
// blocked on that same request, not only on the next one (which was the
// previous, purely reactive behaviour). It is not a hard per-IP concurrency
// bound, though: step 3 only runs after the response completes, so a burst of
// CONCURRENT requests from the same IP can all read the same pre-burst score
// in step 1 and all pass before any of them has recorded outcomes for the
// others to see — a race window bounded by upstream latency × concurrency,
// not by this scoring logic. Volumetric bursts are RateLimit's job (a real
// atomic counter, see ratelimit.go); this middleware's guarantee is about
// score-driven blocking once elevated, not about capping in-flight bursts.
